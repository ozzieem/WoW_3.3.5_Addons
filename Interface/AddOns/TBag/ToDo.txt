Fix Seventh Bank Bag bug

Sorting!
  Add a persistent per character / per bar sort flag
    Make the new mechanism trigger the per bar sort flag
    Make re-sort trigger all per bar flags
    Only sort bars that have the sort flag raised

Memory Usage
  Change new flag to single character
  Change all id's to numbers from strings
  Create ItemSync style itemname array
    Load time function change if ItemSync exists
    Load time function change if CT_Mod exists
  Create String lookup table for types, subtypes, and categories
  Change indices on bags to numbers
    Make sure to prefix mail and body slot info
  Fix timestamps / rarity on empty slots
  Do we need bag type per slot?
  Make Item Link extract 8 numbers, and shorten and expand from :0
    Get rid of item: prefix?


Test key ring
  This Item Begins a Quest not working

Stacking Problems
  Occasionally stuck in cursor.  Why?  Auctioneer testing
  Can we get it to always prefer existing stacks for placement?

UPGRADE:
  Change Hooks to new code call?  How to override bag?

Create Body Viewer
  Expand to link all stats
Create Mail Viewer

Do collectibles from all raid instances
   Molten Core, etc.

Add to mail stack when things are sent to one of your own toons

Rip out lootlink dependencies, add in recipebook
  Heck, root out all the addon dependencies, since they are all messed up

Put searches into own chat window (like fishing buddy) and click on and off

Make portraits update for diff players?

Sleek mode without bags or buttons etc.

Need to close and disable clicking bags on alternate views, maybe highlight

Allow drag and drop onto bank icon, also do highlighting

Get locked appearance to work properly with CT_MailMod

Get graphics to work... maybe cache window height?
