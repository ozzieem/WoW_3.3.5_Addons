  - General forwards compatability to 3.0 code changes.
  - Show Blizzard Bag Frames is obsolete and ignored now.
    Clicking on a bag frame that is hidden in TBag now
    expands the window and displays those items until
    the window is closed or the bag is clicked again.
    Most people will see this mostly with the keychain.
  - Updates to the sort list to support changes in Wrath:
    DeathKnights, Minipets, Tokens, Glyphs and Inscription.
  - Support for Inscription Bags in compressing items to
    leave the most free slots.

  - Bug fixes to the profession tracking code so that more
    professions are tracked properly, especially in non-enUS
    locales.
  - A large amount of code duplication between the bank and
    the inventory window has been merged.
  - Significant effort has been made to decrease the amount
    of global variables used.
  - Significantly fewer hooks are used.
  - Numerous unnecessary frames were removed.
  - New event handlers which are more efficient.
  - Stacking should always happen the next time you open the window

    didn't have the window open when you received the item requiring
    stacking.
  - More reliable caching of mailbox contents.
  - Removed the font that shipped with the addon.  Now simply
    use an included font with the game.  Font usage is now
    more consistent across the addon.
  - Packaged by curseforge now. :)

* 20080611-r163-Shefki
  - Fix an error when opening the Hunter Training window.

* 20080527-r161-Shefki
  - UI rework.  Text buttons are gone, close and lock buttons
    back in topright corner.  Search box at the bottom now.
    All controls are actually inside the window now.
    Special thanks to Daniel Gilbert for permission to use
    the lock buttons.
  - Using the search box will now initiate a new highlight mode.
    The items that match your search will be highlighted in the
    window.  This will persist until you clear the text out
    of the search box, click the highlight button, click the
    Clear Search menu option in the right click menu or simply
    close the inventory window.  The mode is shared between
    the inventory and bank windows.  It overrides the highlight
    mode for the window and the window will return to its
    previous highlight mode.  Note: You have to hit enter
    after typing your search before the highlight mode will
    be entered, text results are still shown in the first
    chat frame.
  - deDE Translation by Dessa.  Thanks to his hard work on
    making this a reality.  Users switching from English
    to the translation will likely want to reset their
    configuration to get the full functionality of the
    translation.
  - You can recategorize individual items in edit mode again by
    right-clicking on them like you could with EngBags.
  - Empty categories/bars will no longer result in lines through
    the window.  The lines often looked like a cursor in a text
    editor and were ugly.
  - You can set the anchor point of the inventory and bank windows.
    The window will grow from the selected corner and that
    corner will never move.  The anchor selection can be
    found by right clicking on blank space in the window
    and using the Anchor sub-menu.
  - When viewing a Hearthstone (or Ruby Slippers) on another
    character it will show the location that hearthstone
    will send you to.  You will have to log onto the character
    after updating before this will fully work.  If the hearth
    destination is unknown it'll simply show <home location>.
  - The number of charges on items (e.g. Mana Oil) will be visible
    on the tooltips when viewing items on other characters
    or items in your bank while not at the bank.  Requires
    having seen the item after updating before this will work.
    The entry on the tooltip may not show exactly where it does
    on live views simply because other addons add their text first.
  - Hiding buttons and other controls will shrink the window
    to remove blank space.
  - Buttons will no longer end up overlapping when the number
    of columns is set low.
  - Fix cooldowns.  The cooldown sweep will show immediately upon
    using an item.  Previously it would only start showing after
    the next reload or toggle of the window.
  - No longer incorrectly show cooldown sweeps when viewing
    items on other characters.
  - Stop attempting to put Quivers and Ammo-pouches inside other
    Quivers and Ammo-pouches.
  - Improve performance when in edit mode in the bank window.
  - Fix a variety of sorting issues.  /tinv resetsorts and
    /tbnk resetsorts will get you a fresh copy of the defaults.
  - Improvements to the text of the tooltips and menus
    for buttons.
  - Change class handling to support other locales.
  - Remove some more old and unused code.


* 20080331-r114-Shefki
  - Fix an issue where the Blizzard API doesn't tell us the item family
    which causes a lua error and breaks updating of the bag contents
    until a reloadui.
  - Fix a possible taint issue with the FluidFrames workaround.
  - Sort Nightmare Seed and Giant Sunfish into the proper places
    with the default config.  Requires /tinv resetsorts and
    /tbnk resetsorts to get the new default config.

* 20080325-r110-Shefki
  - Bump interface to 20400, addon requires WoW 2.4.0 or newer now.
  - Update the Item info database used in categorization to include
    new 2.4 items.
  - Use the new Blizzard API to decide what items can go in what bags,
    this allows the bag compression routines to be 100% accurate now.
  - Allow all modifier key/click combinations from Auctioneer to work.
    Note that this means regardless if alt pickup is set you'll now
    get alt pickup style behavior at the auction house if you have
    Auctioneer installed.  Also note, alt auto panel is still enabled
    so if you have this turned on you may see some mod+click doing
    more than you expect.
  - Add the statues from Jewelcrafting and Sunmotes to the default sort.
    /tinv resetsorts and /tbnk resetsorts if you want to get the
    new default sorts.
  - Remove a bunch of unused code to make the addon slightly smaller.
  - Several changes to diminish the amount of memory being used.
    Users will see the minimal amount of memory the addon uses
    (i.e. immediately after a garbage collection) drop slightly
    and in some cases the maximum amount of memory the addon
    will use (just before a garbage collection) drop significantly.
    In general the addon will no longer grow in the amount of
    memory use through general usage.
  - Fix the quality on items found in a mailbox when searching.  Apparently,
    Blizzard's API is bugged and doesn't give me the real quality of an item.
  - Clicking the reload button wouldn't always force a compression on the
    bank.

* 20080317-r78-Shefki
  - When running on WoW 2.4.0 or newer, always show icons for items
    even if they are not in the item cache.  This is thanks to a new
    functionality of the game.  Will prevent the situation with
    slots showing no icon after a major update until a few viewings
    or actually logging into all characters.  Change is backwards
    compatible, this version will still work with 2.3.x
  - When shift clicking to insert a link of an item in the built in
    bank slots don't include the link twice.
  - Search results will be consolidated again.  Apparently when I fixed
    a problem with the links on items that had enchants or gems in them
    I broke the consolidation and didn't notice it.
  - When in edit mode the column add and delete buttons will now be
    slightly outside the normal window (like the Search box) so that they
    will never overlap with the bag icons or money display.
  - Various small code cleanups to remove unnecessary or duplicate code.
    Also use Blizzard constants for more things.  E.G.  Rather than
    hardcoding the max bag size we use MAX_CONTAINER_ITEMS, if Blizzard
    introduces a larger bag they'll update it and TBag will work without
    requiring an update.
  - The TRADE2 keyword was not always being properly set due to a typo.
  - Stop using message(), some poorly coded addons break this and it will
    not display if the global Display Lua Errors option is unchecked.
    Addon feedback will always go to the default chat frame now.
  - Implement proper support for localization of the addon.  There
    are still no other translations besides enUS but anyone that's interested
    can easily do so now.  Anyone who is interested should contact me.
  - Use in game APIs for getting item quality colors rather than hard coding
    them.  When Item Rarity Color is turned on Common (White) items will now
    have White borders.
  - Implement /tinv resetpos and /tbnk resetpos to allow users to put windows
    back to their default positions so they don't have to reset all settings
    to get them back.
  - Searching should never result in a broken link or an error now.  However,
    until you log into all characters some search results may be missing due
    to insufficient data in the cache to produce links for some items.  Simply
    logging into all characters, looking at their bags, bank and mailbox will
    remedy this situation.
  - Fix a small cosmetic issue with Soul Bags.  The game puts the count of
    Soul Shards on the icon for Soul Bags.  This count didn't show if you
    were on a non-warlock and looked at a warlocks inventory and would
    continue to show on a bag slot if logged into a warlock and logged at
    a non-warlock character.  In both cases the count shows where it should
    and doesn't where it shouldn't now.
  - Closing the Item Socketing window will no longer cause an error in TBag.

* 20071128-r45-Shefki
  - Fix a taint bug that happened when you died.
  - Fix sort of class reagents and darkmoon faire cards.  Hopefully,
    this is all correct now for 2.3.0.  Requires another /tinv resetsorts
    and /tbnk resetsorts

* 20071113-r40-Shefki
  - Update toc for 2.3.0
  - Add support for leatherworking bags to the compression algorithm.
  - Update item info for 2.3.0, there may be some errors in the
    list of items that can go in what container because of a change in
    the formatting the game uses for that information.
  - Update default sorts for the removal of the "Reagent" item type.
    You'll need to do /tinv resetsorts and /tbnk resetsorts to get
    the new sorts.

* 20071030-r37-Shefki
  - Remove extra dev files from zip file included on accident.

* 20071030-r32-Shefki
  - Fixed: Moving items to and from the bank would cause stacking not to
    occur on the receiving side.  Both sides will properly stack now.
    Thanks to Dessa for reporting and helping me debug this problem.
  - Fixed: TBag was not caching bags that were set not to be shown.  If
    you later turned that bag on and then viewed another character that
    you hadn't logged onto with that bag turned on, it would show
    the items for the last character viewed for those slots and not
    position them properly.  Item caches can still be missing some
    data but once all characters have been logged into this issue
    will no longer occur.  Additionally, this allows all bags to show
    in search results even if they are hidden.
  - Fixed: Unhiding the Player dropdown box would cause it to be out of
    sync with the actual status of the window.
  - Standardize version numbers and start including svn rev number.

* 2007-10-22-Shefki
  NOTE: THIS IS A MAJOR UPDATE.  YOU MUST DELETE THE TBag FOLDER IN YOUR
  ADDONS FOLDER AND REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE.  SOME FILES HAVE BEEN
  DELETED AND NEW ONES ADDED.  YOU MUST ALSO COMPLETELY QUIT WOW.
  BACKING UP YOUR WTF FOLDER IS RECOMMENDED FOR THIS RELEASE.
  SOME OF THE ENHANCEMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ONLY APPLY TO THE DEFAULT
  CONFIGURATION.  YOU CAN KEEP MOST OF YOUR CONFIGURATION AND ONLY
  RESET THE SEARCH LIST THAT IS NEEDED TO GET THESE ENCHANCEMENTS BY DOING
  /tinv resetsorts
  /tbnk resetsorts
  YOU MAY WISH TO SCREENSHOT YOUR SORT SETTINGS UNDER ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
  IF YOU HAVE CUSTOMIZED THEM AS THIS WILL WIPE THEM.

  PERFORMANCE & MEMORY USE:
  - Noticeable optimization has been done to the event handling.  Items
    when received should display slightly faster than in the past.
    Users using addons to swap large amounts of gear should notice
    almost no lag over the default UI when swapping large amounts of gear.
    The inventory window will also display quicker than before most of the
    time.  The same optimizations also will lower memory usage some in
    cases, though not necessarily by a huge amount.
  - Reviewed all entries output in the config file and removed obsolete
    entries.  These obsolete entries will be cleaned from every config
    file when TBag loads which should lower memory use, though probably
    not to a noticeable degree.
  - Removed code for portraits and window frames that was no longer
    functional.  Also removed the graphics that were shipped with the
    addon for this that were not being used.  Since these won't be loaded
    should help lower some memory usage.

  UI IMPROVEMENTS:
  - You can now set a bar to be hidden.  This will allow you to hide any
    categories assigned to the bar (e.g. empty bag slots).  Go into edit mode
    right click on a numbered slot and choose the hide option.  Note slots
    that have had their contents changed will be shown despite the setting
    until the next full resort occurs.  This means hidden empty slots will
    show their contents when you put stuff in them and when the resort happens
    they'll get reassigned to a bar and will be visible based upon that bars
  - The button to toggle the interface for buying new bag slots in the bank
    will only appear when at the bank (though the setting is still
    available from the right click menu away from the bank).  It
    will also never appear for characters that have already
    purchased all the bank slots.
  - All UI elements in the inventory and bank windows can be hidden from
    the right click menu for the given frame.
  - You can select the character to display inventory or bank items from
    the right click menu.
  - Added option in Advanced Configuration to turn off rarity coloring.
  - Search box now show Search until you click on it like the search boxes
    for trade skills to make the UI a little more obvious.
  - Hidden bags/keychains will show the blizzard frames when the bag icon
    is clicked on regardless of the show blizzard frames setting.
  - Allow bags in the bank or inventory to be linked by shift clicking on them
    while typing in a chat box again, blizzard removed this from their UI
    which removed it from mine but we like it so implement it ourselves.
  - Added /tinv printchars and /tinv deletechar to allow users to remove
    caches for characters they no longer have.  deletechar takes two arguments
    the character and the realm separated by a space just like printchars
    outputs them.

  SORTING & STACKING:
  - Rewrote the stacking algorithm to be more efficient.  The new algorithm
    should result in fewer moves to complete the stack, will always end
    in full stack with a single pass and will prefer moving items into larger
    stacks and profession bags (if they can go into such bags).
  - Stacking will also now compress your inventory maximizing the number of
    slots that are empty.  This means items that can go in special bags
    (e.g. herb bags, mining bags, engineering bags, enchanting bags) will be
    moved there if there are empty slots.
  - When moving items while stacking in your inventory is now done in a safe
    way.  Previously the addon would not check the locked state of items.  While
    this would never cause the loss of an item it could cause an item to be
    stuck in locked state until the UI was reloaded.  The problem wasn't very
    common because it required a lot of small stacks that needed combining to
    show up but did present itself occasionally when taking AH purchases from
    the mailbox.
  - Updated the categorization rules to include a number of new items and
    added categories for various "collectables" for various factions.
  - Added new categories for each armor slot to to default categorization
    list that makes the armor items sort by slot as well as by name now.
    This should make it easier to find armor items.  As well as giving
    a much more organized look.
  - Profession bags now have their own category for each type of Profession
    bag.  This allows people with multiple profession bags of differing
    professions to keep them more organized.
  - Quivers and Ammo pouches are now categorized separately.  Again should
    allow people with both to have things more organized.
  - The item information on which items belong to which tradeskills has
    been updated to be current.  It has been restructured to allow automated
    updated from a data file included with future releases that will merge
    with any locally collected data from your own tradeskills.  This should
    result in categorization for items used in crafting that stays current.
  - Reagents for crafting no longer receive the keyword for every craft
    they are used for.  This prevents leather from sorting into tailoring
    and gems from sorting into say alchemy simply because a few recipes
    from these crafts happen to use these items and these trades were
    the last to be categorized.  Keywords are now set by the  craft that
    uses an item in the most recipes.  If multiple trades use the item
    the same number of times both keywords will be set.
  - Added explicit rules for some reagents that are used by many trades
    (e.g. motes and primals) so that they don't get pushed into a particular
    trade.
  - Added two new command line options to drop the sort rules and replace
    them by the default included one.  /tinv resetsorts and /tbnk resetsorts
    Highly recommend users backup their configs before doing this in case
    they missed something they liked.  This will not clear any other
    configuration.

  MISC:
  - Updated mail item cache to work with 2.3 mailboxes.  This changes is
    backwards compatible with older versions of the mailbox API and as
    a result this will still work with 2.2.  However, the format of the
    mailbox cache has changed as so you will have to reopen mailboxes on
    all characters to refresh the data.
  - Remove some items from the ToDo list and add others.

  BUG FIXES:
  - Fixed: New categories that are user created will now show on the right
    click menu for the slot box in edit mode without forcing a reload of the
    UI.
  - Fixed: Improper tooltip display while in edit mode on the bank window
    and mousing over the slot target buttons.  2.2.0 compatibility issue
    I missed.
  - Fixed: Properly cache mailbox itemlinks.  TBag was guessing an items link
    from the name which could cause the game to crash when linking mailbox
    items shown in the item link or for items in the mailbox to show incorrect
    info when searched.  Should improve performance when opening the mailbox
    too because it was brute force searching all items looking for one that
    had the same name.
  - Fixed: New tags were at times turning themselves on for no apparent
    reason.  The wrong function to retrieve the time had been used for
    setting timestamps which was creating odd behavior at times between
    sessions.  Some of this may still happen until the bad timestamps
    are cleared (reset NEW tag from right click menu) or replaced by new
    timestamps through normal operation.  Could also show up as items that
    are not new highlighting.
  - Fixed: The highlight around the backpack button on the main menu bar
    will now stay in sync properly.  Yay for Blizzard for finally changing
    their code so I could fix this.
  - Fixed: An extra header entry in the Bindings.xml that was causing an error
    output in the Logs/FrameXML.log file.  TBag is now officially free of any
    FrameXML.log error outputs. Hurray.
  - Fixed: The sub menus under the right click menu will no longer disappear
    making them difficult to click on.

* 2007-09-25-Shefki
  - Bump interface version to match 2.2.0.
  - Changes required to make tooltips function properly with 2.2.0.
  - Fixes to the bank due to changes in the Blizzard bank implementation.
  - Do not open the bank bag frames when not actually at the bank on
    OpenAllBags().
  - Try to avoid sound lag issues from multiple blizzard bag frames
    opening.  Caused by an apparent bug in the 2.2.0 sound system,
    which I've reported, but at least try to avoid exercising the bug.
  - Upped max bag size to 40 slots since there are now 36 slot bags
    on the PTR (at least for premades).
  - Fixed: When show blizzard bag frames was enabled and you were viewing
    another characters inventory clicking on a bag button would open the
    bag even though it was the current characters bag not the character
    you were viewing.
  - Rework processing of clicks due to the new modifier key system in
    2.2.0.

* 2007-06-26-Shefki
  - Fixed: When the bag or bank is closed in edit mode and then
    reopened the edit mode button text would be out of sync and
    say view when it should say edit.
  - Fixed: When viewing inventory of another character, the bag
    icons would sometimes revert to the current character's bag
    icons.
  - Moved the dropdown, search and various buttons at the
    top of the inventory and bank windows to the left side and
    reversed their order.  This avoids the user drop down menu
    from cutting off the screen when a window is positioned at
    the far right of the screen.  Really only had to move the
    user drop down menu but it looked bad if I didn't move the rest.
  - Fixed: Clicking on bag slots when viewing another character's
    inventory will no longer pickup items on the current character.
  - Fixed: Lua error when shift or ctrl clicking an empty slot
    while viewing another character's bags or bank.
  - Fixed: TBag would remove character specific keybindings on
    the first run.
  - Fixed: Lua errors when mousing over a bag slot that had
    no bag in it.
  - Fixed: The FluidFrames addon would prevent the right click
    menu on the inventory or bank window from coming up and
    if you moved the inventory or bank window it would not
    remember it's location.

  - Fixed: Ability to split stacks in bank.
  - Fixed: Backpack button not opening inventory window.
  - Fixed: Bag spotlights weren't clearing when closing inventory
    window in some cases.
  - Fixed: Other mods using OpenAllBags() were causing the blizzard
    frames to open.  BulkMail2 was an example of such an addon.
  - Fixed: When the Keyring is set to show in the inventory window,
    clicking on the keys allows you to properly interact with them.
    Previously, you'd pickup inventory items rather than keys or
    nothing would happen.
  - Fixed: /tinv show, /tinv hide, /tbnk show, /tbnk hide were not
    working.  Fixed them.
  - /tbag is now an alias for /tinv.
  - Shift clicking on bag/backpack/bankbag buttons now produces a
    consistent result.  In particular shift clicking on the backpack
    button will no longer close the inventory window.
  - Removed the Talos from the header on the keybindings.

  - Right clicking on an item in a built in bank slot wasn't moving
    the item to the bag.  Somehow the frame wasn't inheriting
    the proper events, added them back in.
  - Hopefully fixed the stacking problem where the item would get
    stuck in the cursor.  Stacking is still somewhat slow but it
    shouldn't get stuck anymore.  Removed the issue from the
    Todo/Known issues list.

* 2007-06-09-Shefki
  - Fix crash from items with cooldowns in some bank slots.
  - Offline (not at bank) viewing now properly displays items with
    random enchants.
  - Search results of items that have random enchants now show the
    full name and the proper link.
  - Icon for the built in bank slots is no longer a candy sack but
    a more appropriate footlocker like icon.
  - Added an option to disable showing the blizzard bag frames when
    clicking on bag icons.  (Defaults to not showing them).
  - Added support for linking items in chat and using the dressing
    room for offline (not at bank or inventory of other characters).
    Normal shift click and ctrl click behavior to access this
    functionality is available.
  - Added support for Item Comparisons added with WoW 2.1.  Holding
    down shift while hovering over an item will show you what you
    have equipped in the same slots as that item.  Works for
    the bank (offline or online) and bags (current character or not).
    Note: Some items this will not work with.  This is a Blizzard bug,
    if it is not properly set to Class: Armor the comparison tooltips
    will not display.
  - Removed unused files: TBody.xml, TBody.lua, and Save.txt.
  - Added Readme.txt and Changelog.txt.
  - Updated TOC file.  Interface is now set to the current release
    interface.  Removed the ugly color Talos from the Title.
    Added my name to the author line.
