v0.97
Added keybinds for "hide", "show" and "toggle" of the main window
Added command line options for hide and show in addition to the existing toggle
Fixed bug with requiring AceComm

v0.96
Now has default templates
Added timer for fadeout

v0.95
Puts items being rolled on in a new frame you can move around and see results
To toggle the window display type: /lr win 

v0.90b
Now detect when rolls are won/lost and who rolls
In 5-man groups no longer ignores yourself.
Sorting by roll and colors
If the exact same item drops multiple times its random which one will display information
If two of the same item drop and have rolls pending at the same point in time it will get confused
If anyone knows how to disambiguate roll detection of items which have the same link please let me know.  Parsing the chat messages is unreliable and leads to fun with localization

v0.90a
Initial release for testing.
