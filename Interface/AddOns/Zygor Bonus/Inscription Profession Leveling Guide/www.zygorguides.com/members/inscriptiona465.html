<img src="../img/lexicon.png" alt="dk" class="imageleft" />
<h3>Inscription Overview:</h3>
<p>Inscription is a new crafting profession that was introduced in patch 3.0.2. It allows players to alter spells in various ways, including lowering cooldowns, increasing damage, or tweaking spell mechanics (such as stun, knockback, and over time effects). It is a primary profession so it counts as one of the two primary professions a player is allowed to train in. The best complimentary gathering profession to get alongside Inscription is Herbalism since Herbs</p>
<p><h3>Requirements:</h3>
  To be able to train in Inscription you must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>- You must be at least level 5<br />
  - You must have The Burning Crusade expansion installed to learn 1-375<br />
  - You must have Wrath of the Lich Kich expansion installed to learn 375-450</p><br />
