 our server was completely crippled with the huge influx of traffic
 we received, along with the lengthy downtime our site experienced
 last night.</p>

 handle the enormous amount of traffic we have been receiving, so you
 should now be able to purchase your copy of the Version 2.0 guides.
 We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you
 and appreciate your patience and support. </p>
