<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/11187">Auctioneer's and AuctioneerDb's future.</a>
<div class="byline">Norganna - 2009-10-02 20:21:52:</div>
<div class="article">
As you may know, for the past few months I have been taking a break from the daily grind of being &quot;norganna&quot;. I have actually been involved in some of my other projects for this time, and I'm finally ready to come back and have a good look at the future of Auctioneer.<br />
<br />
The current state of affairs is that we have 4 servers running. One of which is reasonably expensive and for all intents and purposed is dedicated to running AuctioneerDb.<br />
<br />
The remaining 3 other servers, are for the Auctioneer development, issue tracking, wikis, forums, email etc.<br />
<br />
Just a bit of background. AuctioneerDb was meant to be a collaborative price database. It was something that many people doggedly asked for over the life of the Auctioneer project, and I have sunk quite a bit of my own time and money (2 years of my spare time, and around $5000 of my own money at this point) into the project to find out that almost nobody is going to use it. We got during the peak of it's use about 100 visitors/day.<br />
<br />
It's a terrible shame to me, thinking that I'm going to have to shut it down and admit failure. Worse, I feel foolish for even taking on this project to start with, which is something that I've been coming to terms with over the last several months.<br />
<br />
I've decided to put out the decision to you guys. If enough of you make a commitment to use it, tell people about it, make donations so that we can continue it, then I'll make a commitment to bring it up to date, get everything back up and running and fund it for the next 6 months even if it is partially coming out of my own pocket to pay for the servers. At the end of the 6 months, we should have enough traffic and data, that with a proportion of the user base as subscribers to the service can cover at least the cost of the servers. <br />
<br />
If not, then I will simply have to face the fact that it's a failure. Sometimes you just can't see things objectively from the inside.<br />
<br />
If you want to pledge your support, make a post in this article and tell some other people you know about what's going on.<br />
<br />
Thanks, norganna.

<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/11040">AuctioneerDB Status</a>
<div class="byline">Nechckn - 2009-08-27 22:50:46:</div>
<div class="article">
Auctioneeros,<br />
<br />
There have been some recurring questions about AuctioneerDB, http://AuctioneerDB.Com , so here is an even more prominent discussion, in addition to those already on the AucDB-specific forums.<br />
<br />
The service has been down for a bit and, although initially planned to be brought back up immediately, there simply has not been the time to address the issues.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to is financial and resource availability.  Both the servers and connectivity cost a decent amount, but the other thing is the manpower to keep the service not only functioning and updated, but progressing - all at a level with which we are confident meets our high standards.<br />
<br />
For the time being, do not expect to be able to upload data, but you can still run the AddOn portion in the back ground on your local installation to continue gathering information, so that new data is ready to go when/if the service is brought back on line.<br />
<br />
Please keep an eye here for any status information, which we will provide once it is available.<br />
<br />
As always, we appreciate everyone's support of our endeavors over the years, and look forward to providing more such innovative AddOns and services into the future.<br />
<br />
Happy Sales,<br />

<u>Current commits (changes, enhancements, fixes):</u><br />
Revision: 4424  Tagging 5.6 Release<br />
Revision: 4423  Create 5.7 Branch to allow for work on next release.<br />
Revision: 4422  Merge of recent fix of typo in BCNT.<br />
Revision: 4421  How did this code ever work previously like this? *BOGGLE* Fix <a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/BCNT-277">BCNT-277</a><br />
Revision: 4420  Merge of recent changes including the reintroduction of the paging fix for the AH, which, apparently was changed during a hotfix or &quot;something&quot;.  Also fix to scandata to ensure it displays, along with the stack size, whenever it is loaded.  Change to allow the BCNT frame to show when the AH is opened and to allow it to be resized.  Some modifications to ENX localization framework, such as strings.<br />
Revision: 4419  Reintroduce the PageOneReturn.lua since, it is quite apparent that the AH has returned to the old, broken behavior.  Also, commented out the auto-disable code so that a new release is not needed for each build.<br />
Revision: 4418  Reintroduce the PageOneReturn.lua since, it is quite apparent that the AH has returned to the old, broken behavior.  Also, commented out the auto-disable code so that a new release is not needed for each build.<br />
Revision: 4417  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/BCNT-276">BCNT-276</a>] The External BeanCounter search window now has a small button in the bottom right that allows the user to drag the window making it wider.<br />
Revision: 4416  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ADV-94">ADV-94</a>] Auctioneer Classic has been decommissioned.  Interaction between advanced and classic is no longer an issue.  Command interface enhanced to show help according to which slash command triggered it, and to act upon auctioneer slash command.<br />
Revision: 4415  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ADV-152">ADV-152</a>] All code to routines found by GetAllModules are wrapped in pcall.  Those places that looked at function outputs now will log to nlog the failure, the other locations just silently ignore the error.<br />
Revision: 4414  <a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ENX-118">ENX-118</a>, <a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ENX-110">ENX-110</a> - update enchantrix constants and baselines for 3.2, update translation strings<br />
Revision: 4413  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/SPRG-8">SPRG-8</a>] Adds percentage calculation to display.  Thanks to Gregity for the code fix for this and <a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/SPRG-3">SPRG-3</a>.<br />
Revision: 4412  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/SPRG-3">SPRG-3</a>] Modifies time left to &quot;Done&quot; once scan is complete.<br />
Revision: 4411  Implements [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/SDAT-6">SDAT-6</a>].  Stack size breakdown now always displayed.  The old code tried to check for there being only a single stack size listed in the snapshot.  If so, it would not display the stack size breakdown.  Unfortunately, the dist.stack table is sparse, and so the return of #(dist.stack) actually returns the size until the first non-existant stack (e.g. a 0 if there is no 1 stack, a 3 if stacks are (1,2,3,10,20), a 5 if they are (1,2,3,4,5,19), etc.).<br />
Since there is no easy, clean way to count the table size for sparse tables, for the moment I've just removed the check altogether.  If saving that one line becomes important down the road, we can add it another table iteration to do a count first.<br />
Revision: 4410  Starts [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ASER-244">ASER-244</a>] The searchUI manifest window will now remember the sort direction and any column order movements the user has mad across sessions.<br />
The columns can be moved by right clicking and dragging the header frame. ALT+Right click to resize a column<br />
Revision: 4409  Merge of recent changes, including workaround in ENX to avoid tooltip issue, fix to tooltip from scandata, and fix so that purchases remove items from snapshot just after purchase.<br />
Revision: 4408  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/SDAT-15">SDAT-15</a>], corrects copy/paste error so that suffix and base totals are reported which match the PriceLevel breakdowns.<br />
Revision: 4407  [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ENX-120">ENX-120</a>] - work around nil links coming into the Enchantrix tooltip handlers for now, leave them as separate tests so we can debug it once we have a reproduceable case<br />
Revision: 4406  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ADV-477">ADV-477</a>]  Returns treating very small result sets as a getAll.  Also moved parameterized commit function to a private function as improper calling could corrupt/taint the scan data.<br />
Revision: 4405  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/APPR-277">APPR-277</a>]  Reverses direction of slider movement in Duration slider when using scrollwheel.<br />
Revision: 4404  Merge of recent changes; BCNT change to allow use of external BCNT window while the AH is opened, removal of the paging fix in FixAH, and change to the disable code.<br />
Revision: 4403  Removes the pageone fix as no longer needed. <br />

Revision: 4400  Adds [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/BCNT-274">BCNT-274</a>] BeanCounter's External search window will be usable at the same time as the AuctionHouse window. It will only hide if the user selects the BeanCounter tab on the AuctionHouse.<br />
Revision: 4399  Merge of recent change to BCNT to help in the recording of &quot;failed&quot; auctions.<br />
Revision: 4398  Fixes [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/BCNT-272">BCNT-272</a>]  Should make failed auctions record more reliably.  Expands time window failed auctions will be matched against from 20 minutes to 4 hours. So we search 2 hours before and 2 hours after estimated posting time. Comments out a lot if debug code, debug will now ONLY report when a mail FAILS to record.<br />
Revision: 4397  Merge of recent changes to help with BCNT's APPR integration and column sorting.  Also change to ensure the setting to integrate/remove the SearchUI from the AH frame functions as expected.<br />
Revision: 4396  Once more, with properties defined.<br />

Revision: 4394 Update Glypher TOC metadata<br />

Revision: 4387  [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/INF-68">INF-68</a>] This replaces the database value with the Blizz-supplied value at the time of lookup.  Still need to remove references to our database value, probably should also remove the display from the extra tooltip, which is now redundant.

<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/10535">Auctioneer and Auctioneer Suite 5.5.4270 Released!</a>
<div class="byline">Nechckn - 2009-05-19 23:10:31:</div>
<div class="article">
Auctioneeros,<br />
<br />
We are pleased to release Auctioneer 5.5, which is fully compatible with World of Warcraft 3.1.x.<br />
<br />
Roughly 60 changes this time, including saving column movement and sorting in BeanCounter and Appraiser, with more modules on the way.  We have also created a special module to help our users deal with the issue where searches on the “Browse” frame do not automatically show the first page of results.  Also, a major change to allow Outliers to display in the Appraiser frame has been implemented.  This always caused some confusion, so the decision was made to allow those outliers to display but keep them from affecting the statistics, as always.  This way, folks can see all of the competition but not have to worry about them poisoning their data.<br />
<br />
Some other highlights include:<br />
<li class="impro">Auctioneer:  Corrected a number of pop-up tooltip items, including adding them to Localizer.  Completed the background changes needed to allow serverKey to function as intended.  This clears the way for eventual cross-faction pricing to, optionally, be shown in the tooltip, et cetera.<br /></li>** SearchUI:  The “Reset” button, that clears all Searcher settings will now require users to hold CTRL+Shift+Alt to help ensure that they realize they will be resetting all SearchUI settings.  Also, implement the code to allow Searchers to select a given Statistics module, the individual Searchers will have access to the code in the next release.  Fixed some outstanding issues that were causing errors.  The permanent “ignore” function should now function appropriately as far as stack size/price is concerned.  Revamped the interface of the Snatch Searcher to make it a bit easier to use, some additional changes will be coming in the next release.<br />
<li class="impro">BeanCounter:  Changes to help BeanCounter better track failed auctions.  Note: There appears to be some server issues that result in the necessary information not being reliably sent all the time, we will watch the situation and update the next release with any needed changes.*  Corrected an incompatibility due to a function change in Altoholic.<br /></li><li class="impro">Enchantrix:  Added an option to show or hide reagent information.  Fixed an issue due to the recent changes by Blizzard that resulted in bank bags appearing like any other and causing the AutoDE feature to sometimes recommend items for processing numerous times.<br /></li><li class="impro">Informant:  Data has been updated for WoW 3.1 and beyond.  Added a new function set that allows other AddOns to obtain vendor data that is included in Informant, such as location, what items they sell, et cetera.<br /></li><li class="impro">All of the very latest http://Localizer.Norganna.Org files have been added, so all of the updates we have, you will see in your localized client. <br /></li>** Please, if you have any sort of decent grasp of any of the languages, we are in need of help localizing Auctioneer, Informant, and the other AddOns listed at http://Localizer.Norganna.Org .<br />
**&quot; Registering&quot; takes only moments and you can be on your way... it is quite simple. Even if you only have the time/inclination to help with a few translations, that will be better than what we have now for some of the locales.<br />
** Before starting, kindly take a look at http://forums.norganna.org/discussion/9517/translation-format/ for some basic thoughts.<br />

<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/10483">AuctioneerDb now at Beta stage</a>
<div class="byline">Norganna - 2009-05-15 00:26:37:</div>
<div class="article">
AuctioneerDb (<a href="http://auctioneerdb.com/">http://auctioneerdb.com</a>) is a searchable auction prices database for World of Warcraft&trade; realms. It provides detailed historical price information for recorded World of Warcraft&trade; auctions, including many different breakdowns of auctions between bids, buyouts, stack sizes, factions, realms, days of the week, and historical prices. AuctioneerDb's aim and primary purpose is to improve the game experience for World of Warcraft&trade; players of all calibers from the basic player who knows nothing about the auction house and just wants to "sell their stuff" to experienced arbitrageurs who play the trading game to buy low and sell high. By allowing free access to detailed auction information, we hope to up our game, level the playing field and stabilize the markets as Auctioneer has been doing now for many years, but at a whole new level.<br/><br/>

I'd like to thank everyone who has helped this last year on the AuctioneerDb project, whether it's to provide advice, development support, debugging assistance, improvement suggestions, or just merely using the product while it was buggy and uploading data.<br/><br/>

We've finally reached that point where the whole thing is ready for public consumption. Up until now, we've been trying to keep things under wraps a little to keep the user base small and manageable by only mentioning it on the Norganna's AddOns websites. However now we think it's finally ready for the general public and as reflects the Beta status, we will start promoting it a little more generally out in the wider internet.

<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/10413">Help testing Auctioneer Suite's BeanCounter mail recording</a>
<div class="byline">Nechckn - 2009-05-05 00:57:50:</div>
<div class="article">
Auctioneeros,<br />
<br />
As many have noticed, there are some odd issues, since roughly WoW Patch 3.1, when visiting the Auction House.<br />
<br />
One among these, is that all of the mail is not being recorded correctly by BeanCounter, notably &quot;failures&quot;.<br />
<br />
To help discern if this is, indeed, some server issue, we could use some help.  If you are interested in helping, be sure to update to the beta/preview release from http://AuctioneerAddOn.Com/dl/#preview using the instructions from http://Wiki.Norganna.Org/Installing .  After updating, please read and follow the instructions at http://forums.norganna.org/discussion/10412/ and be sure to follow up with a post to let us know of your experience.<br />
<br />
**Note that this is a different issue from the &quot;Browse&quot; tab not returning to the first page for all new searches, that is definitely a server issue and occurs for those who use no AddOns.  We are still waiting for a fix or comment, but, as of yet, there has been none.<br />
<br />
Happy Sales,<br />

<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/10219">Auctioneer and Auctioneer Suite 5.4 Released!</a>
<div class="byline">Nechckn - 2009-04-15 02:05:21:</div>
<div class="article">
Auctioneeros,<br />
<br />
We are pleased to release Auctioneer 5.4, which is fully compatible with World of Warcraft 3.1.x.<br />
<br />
Roughly 50 changes this time, including a major overhaul of BeanCounter and its handling of data, although there should be no huge changes on the end-user side.<br />
*A major change this time to the Appraise Frame, including shortening the “sliders” to make them a bit less menacing to the uninitiated, the addition of the “per stack”/ “per each” pricing option by clicking the per stack/ per each to the left of the GSC boxes, and alignment of the option selection boxes to help speed posting, even more.<br />
**Due to these changes, the “Simple” view was removed.  Kindly keep in mind that this is the first major step to the new look, so bear with us during the transition.  We welcome specific, constructive feedback on http://Forums.Norganna.Org , as always, so please swing by with your thoughts and recommendations.<br />
*Another popular change went live, in the code for the SearchUI pop-up.  The “Yes” and “No” boxes will no longer move depending upon the length of the item name.<br />
*The AskPrice module also has had a modification, due to the changes to the chat filter system introduced in WoW 3.1; basically, a change to the order of the function(s).<br />
*AuctioneerDB continues toward completion with a few fixes, including allowing for Realms with hyphens in the name, no longer throwing an error when no sell value provider exists, and adding in Realm/Faction codes.<br />
*Progress continues on [<a href="http://jira.norganna.org/browse/ADV-124">ADV-124</a>] , the serverKey project.  The Auc-Stat-Simple will now provide valid returns, based on Realm, for those looking for cross-realm Arbitrage amounts via home grown code.  This is one step closer to allowing for an option to display another faction/realm in the “official” tooltip- the same goes for Stat-Sales.<br />
*All of the very latest http://Localizer.Norganna.Org files have been added, so all of the updates we have, you will see in your localized client. <br />
 ** Please, if you have any sort of decent grasp of any of the languages, we are in need of help localizing Auctioneer, Informant, and the other AddOns listed at http://Localizer.Norganna.Org .<br />
**&quot;Registering&quot; takes only moments and you can be on your way... it is quite simple. Even if you only have the time/inclination to help with a few translations, that will be better than what we have now for some of the locales.<br />

<div class="byline">Nechckn - 2009-03-25 19:00:07:</div>
<div class="article">
Greetings All,<br />
<br />
Since we have been asked- and to clear up any rumors that may be circulating...<br />
<br />
Auctioneer, Gatherer, and Enchantrix all follow the guidelines published by Blizzard at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/policy/ui.html , according to our understanding of the policy.<br />
<br />
We have never solicited donations in the actual game environment and have never, ever charged for our offerings.<br />
<br />
We do request donations on our primary site, http://AuctioneerAddOn.Com , via the link in the upper right corner, from those who find our AddOns to be helpful.  Those donations primarily help to offset the costs associated with our development environment; a couple servers and their Internet connectivity.<br />
<br />
With a volunteer staff of about 30, usually 5-10 active at a time, spread in different parts of the world, such tools are indispensable to our ability to develop, test, and provide decent products.<br />
<br />
All that said, the donations usually come out about even, with our primary Administrator, Norganna, making up the difference out of his family's bank account on the months that donations do not meet the monthly expenses.  There are some rare months where donations exceed the monthly expenses, but that overage is needed to repay the &quot;loans&quot; from previous months.<br />
<br />
Although some on the team would welcome the opportunity to make a living from development of such complex products, we currently release them under V2 of the GPL.  <br />
<br />
With such a diverse group, there are those who help as a way to &quot;give back&quot; to the world to those who are looking to polish their resume with some real world experience.  As a whole, we do not begrudge those who have decided to depart from producing AddOns, due to what ever reason(s), and support any company's right to protect its property.  This current period is quite interesting as numerous laws are being enacted and tested in different courts to determine the future of software development, and only time will tell.<br />
<br />
Those who feel strongly, one way or another, should contact Blizzard and their elected officials, directly, and express their opinions.  Demands, comments, or requests on websites only go so far, and most often not to those with the authority to make the desired changes.  Luckily most of us live in areas where making such opinions known is not only possible, but encouraged.<br />
<br />
We look forward to providing products that enhance our users' experiences, and our own, for now, and into the future.  Should there ever be any internal or external decisions that do affect our products, we will endeavor to keep everyone informed, to the greatest possible extent.  <br />
<br />
In keeping with our usual spirit of openness, the new guidelines may affect the future of the AuctioneerDB program, which is in early beta status, but no decisions have been made as of yet.  We will post with more details, once they are available.<br />
<br />
Happy Adventuring,<br />
<br />
Nikk and the rest of the Norganna's AddOns family

<br/><a class="headline" href="http://norganna.org/discuss/discussion/9921">Auctioneer 5.3 Released!</a>
<div class="byline">Nechckn - 2009-03-02 02:46:36:</div>
<div class="article">
Auctioneeros, <br />
<br />
Due to some help from our multi-lingual friends, the release of Auctioneer and Auctioneer Suite 5.3 contains many more interface/interaction translations. <br />
<br />
We can always use more help in that department, especially if you use a localization that is not complete. Simply visit http://Localizer.Norganna.Org , create an account, select your specific locale, and begin entering relevant translations, based on the context. <br />
<br />
Happy Sales, <br />
